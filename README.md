# TrackChain Framework

The TrackChain Framework is a versatile and modular software architecture designed to establish immutable trust and total transparency within critical supply chains. It is perfectly aligned with the Hedera Hackathon tracks focusing on Real-World Assets (RWA) Tokenization and DLT for Operations, built upon the secure and high-performance foundation of Hedera Hashgraph.

## Modules

The TrackChain framework is composed of three core modules that work together to provide a complete solution for supply chain management:

- **[Track-Collect](./collect/README.md)**: The data entry point and primary interface for field actors. It is a simple, dedicated application (mobile or web) responsible for the raw data collection.
- **[Track-Core](./core/README.md)**: The secure engine of the architecture. Implemented as an API server, it manages all the complex logic required to interact with the Hedera network.
- **[Track-Verify](./verify/README.md)**: The public-facing interface for verifying the authenticity and history of assets. It allows users to query the Hedera network to retrieve information about specific assets.

## Target Applications

TrackChain is positioned as a flexible framework ready for rapid deployment in areas like:

- Agriculture
- Land Registry
- Healthcare
